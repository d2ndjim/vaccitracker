### ABOUT VACCITRACKER

# Background

> There are an estimated 350,000 births around the world everyday. Even though we all come from different cultures and geographies there are some common threads during the birth of a child. It is usually a period of celebration of new life, but at the same time it's the beginning of a new responsibility, especially for the parents. From day one the child needs to begin taking the required immunisations to protect them from diseases and to ensure proper growth and development. The parents need to remember when and what vaccines need to be taken and also to ensure they attend their immunization appointments on schedule. This can be challenging especially for parents with busy schedules or first time parents. From the survey results linked in the appendix below more than 60% of parents said they have missed an immunization appointment and forgetting the date was the major reason. Most parents either rely on the hospital immunization card which can easily be misplaced or damaged, or they try to keep track with a diary. When parents forget their childrenâ€™s immunization appointment more than 60% of them have negative feelings about themselves and feel like bad parents. Research has found that these negative feelings can have a further negative impact on the health of the child.
