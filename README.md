# ABOUT VACCITRACKER

### Background

- There are an estimated 350,000 births around the world everyday. Even though we all come from different cultures and geographies there are some common threads during the birth of a child. It is usually a period of celebration of new life, but at the same time it's the beginning of a new responsibility, especially for the parents. From day one the child needs to begin taking the required immunisations to protect them from diseases and to ensure proper growth and development. The parents need to remember when and what vaccines need to be taken and also to ensure they attend their immunization appointments on schedule. This can be challenging especially for parents with busy schedules or first time parents. From the survey results linked in the appendix below more than 60% of parents said they have missed an immunization appointment and forgetting the date was the major reason. Most parents either rely on the hospital immunization card which can easily be misplaced or damaged, or they try to keep track with a diary. When parents forget their childrenâ€™s immunization appointment more than 60% of them have negative feelings about themselves and feel like bad parents. Research has found that these negative feelings can have a further negative impact on the health of the child.

### User Stories

- As a parent I want to know in advance if my child has an upcoming immunization appointment so that I can plan and not forget.
- As a parent I want to know from time to time all the immunizations that my child has taken and if there is any outstanding one so I can have informed discussions with our doctor.
- As a parent I would like to have a general idea of what each immunization does and possible side effects, so if they do happen I will know what to do and expect.
- As a parent to more than one children I want to be able to keep track of all of my childrenâ€™s immunization appointments without mixing them up

### Solution

- A web app with real time email and calendar notifications and reminders  that informs parents in advance of appointments. The parent will be able to create a family profile and also add their significant partner as well as other guardians as Co-contributors with different roles and permissions. They can add multiple children profiles including the name of the child, a profile pic, date of birth, sex etc. They will also be able to fill in general data like their country of residence and address, which would inform the vaccination schedules as well as provide them with a list of recommended health centers in the vicinity. The solution should also have a library of immunisations in easy to understand language with the basic information a parent should have.
## Immunisations are region specific and due to differences between regions, the first version of the solution will be focusing on Nigeria and other African countries with similar schedules.
